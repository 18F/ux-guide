    <h1>Plan your research</h1>
  
  <p><strong>We do many different kinds of research at 18F — with each project, we aim to design research that fits the needs and constraints of the partner, product, and team. That said, some practices have emerged as norms that can be a useful starting-point for getting comfortable conducting research on 18F projects. These are not perfect best practices; this is just a list of tips, tricks, and common elements to help you get started and understand what your colleagues expect.</strong></p>

<h1 id="plan-your-research">Plan your research</h1>

<p>Planning research often takes longer than you expect, and is a crucial step for making the most of users’ time once you do sit down with them. It’s not unusual for research planning to take a week or two of dedicated time, and it often includes many conversations about goals, expectations, and logistics.</p>

<h2 id="write-a-research-plan">Write a research plan</h2>

<p>This document should make these things clear:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What big questions are you trying to answer?</li>
  <li>Is it generative research? Stakeholder interviews? Usability testing?</li>
  <li>How many people are you hoping to talk to? This can be a wide range, but should help set expectations for scale; 5-8 interviews is a very different undertaking than 30+ sessions.
    <ul>
      <li>Resource: Why You Only Need to Test with 5 Users</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>How will you find participants? What’s the plan for recruiting them? Sometimes you’ll want to start on recruiting even before your plan is finalized, because it’s a common timeline torpedo.</li>
  <li>When do you know you’re done with this round/sprint of research?</li>
  <li>What should this research help you do?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>There are a few kinds of research that are especially common here:</strong></p>

<p>(Of course, choose the research methods that are most appropriate for the product and project; this is just to note what we have the most patterns for.)</p>
<ul>
  <li>Generative stakeholder or user interviews (remember to be clear about which you’re doing, and target questions and synthesis accordingly)</li>
  <li>Remote contextual inquiry or usability testing
    <ul>
      <li>Heuristics for quality usability testing</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Brief in-person usability sessions through intercept testing
    <ul>
      <li>Quickstart: Intercept research in GSA buildings</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2 id="write-a-script-to-guide-interviewers">Write a script to guide interviewers</h2>

<p>Most research scripts include these sections:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Introductory preamble
    <ul>
      <li>Remind them that this is not a test of them, and there are no wrong answers</li>
      <li>Remind them that this is voluntary, and they can call it at any point if they no longer want to participate</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Consent for note-taking or recording
    <ul>
      <li>Tell them how you’ll use the notes</li>
      <li>Tell them whether you’ll attribute any quotes</li>
      <li>Consent form, if needed (for remote sessions, this likely needs to be handled in pre-interview correspondence)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>What questions to ask</li>
  <li>Potential follow-up questions</li>
  <li>Concluding thanks, questions, or invitations to follow up</li>
</ul>

<p>Resource: Avoiding bias in the oh-so-human world of user testing</p>

<h2 id="plan-to-include-partners-and-team-members">Plan to include partners and team members</h2>

<p>Figure out who will be participating in research, and work with them on both of those elements. If you have partners or team members who are new to research, make time to walk them through the plan and script so they can ask questions and understand what to expect. If you have folks who are new to research, and you expect them to take notes, train them on research note-taking! If you have multiple notetakers/observers, talk about how to work together and avoid stepping on toes during note-taking.</p>

<h2 id="prepare-materials">Prepare materials</h2>

<p>For some research (for instance, usability testing), you’ll need to work with other designers, developers, and writers to build a prototype to put in front of users. These materials should be identified in the research plan, so that the team can be ready with the design and functionality you’re hoping to test. You’ll also need a plan to publish or share the prototype with users (for instance, a link to send or a print-out).</p>
