# User experience guide

This is the beginning of a guide that will house resources, norms, and practices for doing user experience research and design work at 18F.

This site uses [Federalist](https://federalist.18f.gov/) and the [USWDS Jekyll theme](https://github.com/18F/uswds-jekyll). [You can preview the site on Federalist.](https://federalist-proxy.app.cloud.gov/site/18f/ux-guide/)
