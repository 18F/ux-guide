    <h1>Conduct research sessions</h1>
  
  <h1 id="conduct-research-sessions">Conduct research sessions</h1>

<p>For each session, you’ll need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Interviewer</li>
  <li>Notetaker</li>
  <li>Location (physical or virtual)</li>
  <li>Participant</li>
</ul>

<p>Resource:</p>

<ul>
  <li>My Best Advice for Conducting User Interviews</li>
  <li>Build empathy with stakeholder interviews, part 1: Preparation</li>
  <li>Build empathy with stakeholder interviews, part 2: Conversation</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="set-up-supporting-documents">Set up supporting documents</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Spreadsheet of participants, with codenames and columns to track whether they’ve been contacted, interviewed, thanked, etc.
    <ul>
      <li>This is PII! Make sure only the core research team has access</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Folder for research notes, with blank/template notes documents
    <ul>
      <li>Never use real names in these documents</li>
      <li>Make sure permissions are restricted to core research team</li>
      <li>Don’t try to intersperse notes with the interview script, it’s confusing as hell (you can include the script for reference, but it’s much easier to have a blank “notes” section at the bottom of the doc for notetakers to work in)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Invitation email (or other recruiting materials) explaining what the research is about and what to expect — in a way that won’t bias the research in unintended ways</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="make-a-consistent-usable-record-of-the-session">Make a consistent, usable record of the session</h2>

<p>For much of the research we do at 18F, we use detailed note taking either in lieu of or in addition to audio/video recording. It’s important to align about what kind of notes the team should be taking so that:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Team members who weren’t able to attend the session are able to take a look at the notes and get a very clear sense of what the user said, did, and felt</li>
  <li>Researchers capture all the details so that when our memories do eventually fade, we can refer back to the notes</li>
  <li>The notes can become the starting point for synthesis sessions that will then lead to tangible changes in the app/service</li>
</ul>

<p>In general, we try to take verbatim notes, to the extent it’s possible. Try simply typing down most of what a person says during each session. Avoid thinking ahead, summarizing what you think they mean, or planning what to fix/change. The idea here is to capture as much as possible during this precious time we have with our users, and avoid introducing cognitive biases by selecting what to write or not write.</p>

<p>It’s often impossible to get every single word; if need be, prioritize capturing more exact phrasing from the user, rather than the interviewer.</p>

<p>Don’t fix spelling, punctuation, or grammar while taking notes — you can do this afterward. If there are two notetakers, trade off who takes notes for each answer. Avoid working too close to each other (for instance, fixing a word before the other person has finished typing the next word), as it can be distracting.</p>

</ul>

<h2 id="prepare-logistics-to-respect-users-time">Prepare logistics to respect users’ time</h2>

<p>During research sessions, users are doing us a favor. Do whatever you can to ensure that they have a good experience.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Schedule a little more time than you think you’ll need — it can take a few minutes to get everyone on the line, or you may have an especially chatty participant. An extra 15 minutes can keep it from feeling rushed.</li>
  <li>Make sure calendar invites are clear, both to users and your fellow researchers (for PII-protection and clarity, it sometimes makes sense to use separate team-facing and user-facing invites).</li>
  <li>Send the correct docs to notetakers ahead of time, and make sure they know who they are.</li>
  <li>Ask any research team members to show up 2-5 minutes early.</li>
  <li>Test your call-in line, screen sharing tools, or video conference before your first session.</li>
  <li>Confirm with participants that they’ll be able to use conferencing, video, or screen sharing tools, and come up with a backup plan if they can’t.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="make-the-user-comfortable">Make the user comfortable</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Introduce everyone on the call, and make clear who’s taking notes or observing.</li>
  <li>Leave enough time for notetakers or observers to ask follow-up questions at the end.</li>
  <li>Leave time for the interviewee to ask questions.</li>
  <li>Adapt the script as needed to make the interviewee comfortable and be respectful of their time.</li>
  <li>Thank them for their time and be very clear about any follow-up promised.</li>
</ul>
