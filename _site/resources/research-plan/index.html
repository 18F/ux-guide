  <h1 id="research-plan">Research Plan</h1>

<p>*Refer to the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M3GP1JWW9mlZAAONklogurd8qXZLLgBqcKfU5HiS9h0/edit#">Research plan template </a> to use this as a Google Doc. *</p>

<h2 id="study-objectives--problem-statement">Study objectives / problem statement</h2>
<p>Study objectives often relate to a larger vision laid out in something like a research strategy document.</p>

<p>In <em>Just Enough Research</em>, designer Erika Hall suggests framing studies using active verbs like “describe”, “evaluate”, or “identify” and avoiding open-ended verbs like “understand” or “explore.”</p>

<h2 id="research-leads">Research lead(s)</h2>
<p>Name the person(s) ultimately responsible for the quality and execution of this study: The keeper of the checklists and the person who will schedule study-related meetings (partner training, interviews, collaborative synthesis, etc.).</p>

<h2 id="timeline">Timeline</h2>
<p>Give a rough-estimate timeline for project leads and partners to help manage expectations around study execution. For example:</p>

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>Syntax</th>
      <th>Description</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>Study design</td>
      <td>[A reasonable date range]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Recruiting</td>
      <td>[A reasonable date range]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Interviews</td>
      <td>[A reasonable date range]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Top-line synthesis</td>
      <td>[A reasonable date range]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Collaborative analysis</td>
      <td>[A reasonable date range]</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Summary/outputs</td>
      <td>[A reasonable date range]</td>
    </tr>

<h2 id="research-questions">Research questions</h2>
<p>Use this space to elaborate on the questions motivating this study. This is a list of the questions motivating our research, not necessarily the questions we plan to ask participants! It’s useful to get the whole team involved in creating these by facilitating some kind of “brain dump” exercise.</p>

<p><strong>Examples:</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>What are our customer’s reactions to these designs? What stands out?</li>
  <li>Which prototype do people prefer for creating complex literature queries?</li>
  <li>Where do our customers struggle to achieve their goals?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="methods">Method(s)</h2>
<p>Using your research questions as guides, pick a method or two from https://methods.18f.gov/. Make sure your team, including the agency partner, understands the methods you’ll employ before the study!</p>

<h2 id="recruiting">Recruiting</h2>
<p>Describe at a high level how you’ll recruit for this study.</p>

<p><em>need content about solicitation - ex. open forums that are accessible to the general public</em></p>

<p>If you’re conducting a usability test, consider answering the following questions (based on <a href="https://articles.uie.com/usability_testing_three_steps/">this article</a>):</p>
<ol>
  <li>What behaviors are we looking for?</li>
  <li>What level of tool knowledge and access do participants need?</li>
  <li>What level of domain/topic knowledge do participants need?</li>
  <li>How can we ensure diverse perspectives?</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="recruiting-tools">Recruiting tools</h3>
<p>There are a number of tools that can be used for recruiting. A few tools commonly employed at 18F include:</p>

<p>** Screeners **</p>

<p>Screeners are useful in cases where an email invite alone won’t guarantee that participants meet the recruitment criteria you’ve outlined above. Screeners may be subject to PRA; see <a href="https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/107KndQ8St_vaFgb8KvzFNvIdNRQXbbc3XmIkKJm42jg/edit">this flowchart</a> as a starting point, and be sure to consult with agency desk officers. Note: 18F worked with OPP to create our <a href="https://18f.gsa.gov/2017/11/08/four-lessons-we-learned-while-building-our-own-design-research-recruiting-tool/">own remote recruiting tool</a>, for more information, ping <a href="">#research-tools</a> in Slack.</p>

<p>** Emails **</p>

<p>Once you have users to contact, send invitations via email. There are several emails needed during the recruiting phase. Each email should give recipients a clear idea of what to expect, what they are giving consent for, and an easy way to decline or end the process. We created a few templates to help you get started:</p>

<p>Invitation email template</p>

<p>Research participant email agreement template</p>

<h2 id="interview-prompts">Interview prompts</h2>
<p><em>Need content here</em></p>

<h2 id="expected-outcomes">Expected outcomes</h2>
<p>Write a pre-mortem: How will the team’s design context change after this study? What design decisions will this study inform? What documentation will be updated? What artifacts will be made/updated?</p>

<p>** Examples: **</p>
<ol>
  <li>We’ll collect evidence as to which which design better supports users’ workflow.</li>
  <li>We’ll add to our design context document, and share it out to the rest of the team.</li>
  <li>We’ll refine our user stories with acceptance criteria informed by real feedback.</li>
</ol>
