# Research plan

## Background

> **Instructions:** Summarize important context, research, case studies, literature reviews, etc. that should shape the team’s inquiry. Provide links, if possible.

Background information goes here.


## Goals / problem statement

> **Instructions:** Drawing on Erika Hall’s *Just Enough Research*, objectives should employ reality-oriented words like “describe”, “evaluate”, or “identify,” and avoid intangible ones like “understand” or “explore.” Challenge [risky assumptions](https://mvpworkshop.co/validate-riskiest-assumption/) and [unknowns](https://medium.com/mule-design/dig-in-the-right-spot-6dc7af5a75e8).


1. Objective 1
1. Objective 2

## Research questions 

**Note:** These are not the same as those posed to participants (“interview questions”). 

> **Instructions:** What do you want to learn to make better evidence-based decisions? Good questions are specific, actionable, and practical; they often concern the user’s experience and needs. See [this exercise](https://twg-x-uxr.gitbook.io/plays/research-alignment-workshop) for collaboratively creating research questions.

1. Question 1
2. Question 2


## Method(s)

> **Instructions:** Choose some [Methods](https://methods.18f.gov)! Ensure the team understands these before the study. 


## Research roles

> **Instructions:** Review the [roles](https://github.com/18F/ux-guide/blob/master/_pages/research/basics.md#research-is-a-team-sport) outlined in the 18F UX Guide.

- Research lead
- Moderator
- Observer(s)

## Timeline

> **Intrusctions:** Give a rough-estimate timeline for project leads and partners to help manage expectations around study execution. Remember to give more time than you think you need to analysis and synthesis (a safe estimate is twice as long as you give to data collection).

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Study design      |  [A reasonable date range] |
| Recruiting   |  [A reasonable date range] |
| Data collection (e.g., interviews) |  [A reasonable date range] |
| Top-line synthesis   |  [A reasonable date range] |
| Collaborative analysis   |  [A reasonable date range] |
| Collaborative synthesis   |  [A reasonable date range] |
| Summary/outputs   |  [A reasonable date range] |



## Participants and recruiting

> **Intructions:** Describe at a high-level who should participate (see [these helpful questions](https://articles.uie.com/usability_testing_three_steps/)) in this study and you’ll recruit them. Prepare [email templates](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XXRBdGGrMMKZ0qnbPXgulCFrCQBf2slP) for corresponding with potential participants. See the [legal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13FWBP5wMf_MgDToVBBrkOafFe5T8NsldzttGENhGgSU/edit#) page of the UX Guide for more information. 


## Ethical and bias considerations 

> **Instructions:** Review the [bias](https://github.com/18F/ux-guide/blob/master/_pages/research/bias.md) and [ethics](https://github.com/18F/ux-guide/blob/master/_pages/research/ethics.md) information in the 18F UX guide. List any ethical concerns the team should review. Consider especially if this research treats people as [ends or means](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categorical_imperative), and how it might look if this research were to appear in tomorrow’s news.

- Consideration 1
- Consideration 2

## Expected outcomes

> **Instructions:** Write a pre-mortem: How will the team’s design context change after this study? What design decisions will this study inform? What documentation will be updated? What artifacts will be made/updated?

** Examples: **
1. We’ll collect evidence as to which which design better supports users’ workflow.
1. We’ll add to our design context document, and share it out to the rest of the team.
1. We’ll refine our user stories with acceptance criteria informed by real feedback.
