## Background

> Describe factors that the research will need to account for, including any shared beliefs or forces motivating the research itself. Summarize any past research or information that shape the research context.


## Goals

> When writing your [research goals]({{site.baseurl}}/research/plan/#goals), use reality-oriented words like “describe”, “evaluate”, or “identify,” and avoid intangible ones like “understand” or “explore.” Consider how this research will help reduce risk and inform decisions.


## Research questions

> What do you want to learn to make better evidence-based decisions? [Good research questions]({{site.baseurl}}/research/plan/#research-questions) are specific, actionable, and practical; they usually center around users' experiences and needs.


## Method(s)

> **Instructions:** Choose some [methods]({{site.baseurl}}/research/plan/#methods) that are appropriate for meeting the goals and answering research questions.


## Research roles

> **Instructions:** Consider how research can be [a team activity]({{site.baseurl}}/research/clarify-the-basics/#a-team-activity) and decide who will hold specific [research roles]({{site.baseurl}}/research/do/#clarify-team-roles).

- Research lead
- Moderator
- Observer(s)


## Timeline

> **Instructions:** Document the estimated [timeline]({{site.baseurl}}/research/plan/#timeline) for completing this research. Plan more time than you think you need.

## Participants and recruiting
> Describe at a high-level [who should participate in this study]({{site.baseurl}}/research/plan/#participants-and-recruiting), and how you’ll recruit them. Consider how the team will communicate with participants, for example [by email]({{site.baseurl}}/resources/#email-templates) and how the team will get [informed consent]({{site.baseurl}}/research/do/#getting-informed-consent) from participants.
