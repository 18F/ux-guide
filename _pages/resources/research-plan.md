# Research plan

## Background

> Background information goes here.


## Goals

> Use reality-oriented words like “describe”, “evaluate”, or “identify,” and avoid intangible ones like “understand” or “explore.”


## Research questions 

> What do you want to learn to make better evidence-based decisions? Good questions are specific, actionable, and practical; they usually center around the user’s experience and needs.


## Method(s)

> **Instructions:** Choose some [Methods](https://methods.18f.gov)! Only perform the research activities that you believe will best inform the design decisions you anticipate. Ensure the team understands these methods *before* you do the research.


## Research roles

> **Instructions:** Review the [roles](https://github.com/18F/ux-guide/blob/master/_pages/research/basics.md#research-is-a-team-sport) outlined in the 18F UX Guide.

- Research lead
- Moderator
- Observer(s)

## Timeline

> **Intsructions:** Give a rough-estimate timeline for project leads and partners to help manage expectations around study execution. Remember to give more time than you think you need to analysis and synthesis (a safe estimate is twice as long as you give to data collection).

| Syntax      | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| Study design      |  [A reasonable date range] |
| Recruiting   |  [A reasonable date range] |
| Data collection (e.g., interviews) |  [A reasonable date range] |
| Top-line synthesis   |  [A reasonable date range] |
| Collaborative analysis   |  [A reasonable date range] |
| Collaborative synthesis   |  [A reasonable date range] |
| Summary/outputs   |  [A reasonable date range] |



## Participants and recruiting

## Ethics considerations 


## Expected outcomes

> Write a pre-mortem: How will the team’s design context change after this study? What design decisions will this study inform? What documentation will be updated? What artifacts will be made/updated?
