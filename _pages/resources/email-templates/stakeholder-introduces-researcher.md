Hi `[Colleagues]`,  

To inform `[strategic decision]`, leadership has decided to invest in research to `[research objective (e.g., describe, identify, or evaluate something)]`. I've recommended you as someone that our researcher(s) should contact early based on your experience and expertise.  

`[Researcher]` will be reaching out to you individually very soon. Please find some time to schedule with `[researcherâ€™s pronoun]` if you can within the next week or so. Your comments will help inform the rest of the research process, and we may call on you again based on some future ideas we have.  

Thank you for your time and I look forward to seeing what `[researcher]` comes back with based on your input! If you have any questions, feel free to give me a call.  

Thanks,  
`[Key stakeholder]`
