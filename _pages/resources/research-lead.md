# Research lead (role description)

While being mindful that [18F practices research as a team sport](https://github.com/18F/ux-guide/blob/master/_pages/research/basics.md), research leads should:

- **Set the research agenda.** Determine the team’s research needs (for example, [inform its anticipated design decisions](https://medium.com/mule-design/dig-in-the-right-spot-6dc7af5a75e8) or [validate its riskiest assumptions](https://mvpworkshop.co/validate-riskiest-assumption/)), and propose right-sized studies to address them, highlighting cost and trade-offs. Identify allies who will advocate for research. If stakeholders exhibit resistance, identify the sources of that resistance and develop appropriate responses. 
- **Educate others on the role, types, and methods of research.** Help the team understand the different types of research (foundational, generative, evaluative), and why specific research [methods](https://methods.18f.gov) apply. Explain how to employ specific methods. Facilitate [research retrospectives](https://18f.gsa.gov/2018/10/23/two-exercises-for-improving-design-research-through-reflective-practice/) to encourage reflective practice.
- **Identify and recruit a diverse and representative group of people to participate in design research, and inform their consent.** Facilitate the creation of [behavioral audience segments](http://adaptivepath.org/uploads/documents/apr-007_taskbased.pdf) and setup repeatable participant recruiting processes. Help the team understand the importance of diversity in recruiting.
- **Keep the team's research on track and on time.** Plan for and execute studies around shared goals with predictable scope. Incorporate asynchronous tasks like “homework”, diary studies, etc. to make the best use of everyone’s time. Encourage [collaborative research analysis](https://18f.gsa.gov/2018/02/06/getting-partners-on-board-with-research-findings/) and synthesis, and help the team manage transitions between learning and building. 
- **Maintain quality.** Identify and mitigate risks to quality design research, such as ethics, bias, and privacy and legal risk (for example, help the team understand how to conduct research that is Paperwork Reduction Act-compliant by design). Ensure rigor with [checklists](https://methods.18f.gov/interview-checklist/).
- **Make research visible.** Inspire others to adopt a richer and more nuanced perspective of the people for whom they’re solving problems. Help people take findings back to the organization in a way that can be acted upon. Update project-level onboarding, knowledge management, etc. to reflect the research done to date.
