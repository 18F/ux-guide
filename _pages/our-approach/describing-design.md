# Describing design

We see design as a process of intentionally deciding, over and over, how interactions should work for users based on research. Being clear in how we describe design helps align our approach.


### Design is an intentional series of decisions

Every project is shaped by a series of design decisions, whether those decisions be about a meeting agenda, a research plan, or a proof of concept. (Design is also meta in that you can design the process by which design decisions are made.)


### Design happens in context

Designers actively explore the context in which they’ll make decisions. IDEO, for example, [identifies](https://designthinking.ideo.com/) important concerns such as desirability, feasibility, and viability.
- **Desirability** asks does this design satisfy user needs?
- **Feasibility** asks is this design technically possible? 
- **Viability** asks is what we’ve designed sustainable?


### User-centered design is for actual humans

Stakeholders are anyone that has a legitimate interest in the design process, including bosses, agency partners, and users. But users hold a special place at 18F. In helping promote “government for the people” we constantly talk with users to understand their needs (how do things work now? what makes them frustrated?) and determine whether or not our design decisions will meet those needs.


### Done together, design produces shared understanding

Designers rely on two kinds of thinking:

- **Divergent thinking** helps us identify what we might make decisions about, and explore possible choices
- **Convergent thinking** helps us narrow our choices, and follow through on our decisions

Thoughtfully transitioning between divergence and convergence, as a team, helps us create shared understanding—not just explicit knowledge (like a list of all possible choices), but [tacit knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge) (like an intuition about which choices are feasible).


### Design is never done

Designers don’t have all the answers. And that’s okay. To inform our judgement, we take a hypothesis-driven approach. We try things out, and encourage feedback. We commit to continuous improvement (which the Japanese call *kaizen)* by soliciting [critiques](http://scottberkun.com/essays/23-how-to-run-a-design-critique/), conducting [usability tests](https://methods.18f.gov/usability-testing), etc.
