# Defining design

We see design as a process of intentionally deciding, over and over, how interactions should work for users based on research. But this is just a starting point. The following concepts help clarify what we mean.


### Design is an intentional series of decisions

Every project is shaped by a series of decisions, whether those decisions are about meeting agendas, research plans, or what constitutes a minimum-viable product or service. Design is also meta: we can design the process by which decisions are made.


### Design happens in context

What’s appropriate? It depends. We use design research to better understand the problems we might solve, and [the systems those problems connect to](https://quotesondesign.com/eliel-saarinen/). We actively validate the appropriateness of our solutions.


### User-centered design is for actual humans

Stakeholders are anyone with a legitimate interest in what we’re designing. Stakeholders include our agency partners and the people they serve—that is, their users. While all design processes must balance stakeholder needs, our process is user-centered: in addition to regularly talking with our agency partners, we proactively engage with users to understand their needs (How well do things work for them now?) and determine how well our decisions have met those needs.


### Done together, design produces shared understanding

We join cross-functional teams to arrive at more well informed, less [biased](/research/bias/) decisions. Moreover, we rely on two kinds of thinking:
- **Divergent thinking** helps us identify the things we might make decisions about, and explore possible choices
- **Convergent thinking** helps us narrow our choices, and follow through on our decisions

Intentionally transitioning between divergence and convergence helps us create shared understanding—not just explicit knowledge (like a list of all possible choices), but [tacit knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tacit_knowledge) (like an intuition about which choices are feasible).

### Design shapes organizations, and vice versa

Products and services impose requirements on the organizations that support them, and vice versa. We can’t prudently design an agency’s homepage to include images on every news post, for example, if we haven’t yet determined if that agency can feasibly source images for each of its news posts.


### Design is never done

We don’t have all the answers. And that’s okay. We take an iterative, cyclical, [lean](/our-approach/stay-lean) approach. We try things out. We commit to continuous improvement (which the Japanese call *[kaizen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaizen))* using [critiques](http://scottberkun.com/essays/23-how-to-run-a-design-critique/), [usability tests](https://methods.18f.gov/usability-testing), etc.
