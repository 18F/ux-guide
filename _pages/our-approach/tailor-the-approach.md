Agency differences, such as access to prototyping or screen-sharing software, can substantially affect our partners’ ability to participate in the design process. Our team tailors our approach to encourage short-term participation and long-term sustainability.

While our short-term goal is rooted collaborative design practice, our long-term goal is to help the agencies we partner with become more expert at understanding user needs and improving their product or services’ to better meet those needs. In doing this work, we often must tailor our approach to whatever works best within our partner agencies. This helps them see user-centered design as not just a pragmatic tool for government service delivery, but a practicable one.

When tailoring our approach to our agency partners, we are especially mindful of:
- Design maturity
- Remote friendliness
- Access to tools
- Security and privacy
- Ethics and bias considerations
- Public engagement

## Design maturity

Many agencies choose to work with 18F so that they can build a product or service while also learning to adopt our user-centered design practices. As a consequence, many engagements begin with our asking some questions related to design maturity (for example, what is our partner’s design research awareness and ability?). Getting a sense of where the partner is at in terms of design maturity helps us to incorporate lightweight instructional design and coaching into our day-to-day work. 

Many of the people we work with do not have “design” in their job title. Nevertheless, we frequently encourage their participation in the design process. Over time, we might engage with agency leadership to better manifest their agency’s decision-making processes, and to clarify the role of in-house designers.

Finally, design maturity comes back to good practice: For example, how often does the team engage in critique? How do they think about design and research operations?

## Remote friendliness

18F is a remote-first team. Many federal agencies are not. We’re mindful of how to might best include the partner when planning meetings, research sessions, synthesis activities, etc. While we’re vocal proponents of remote work, we understand that some situations will call for us to show up in person.


## Access to tools

18F has fairly unique access to research, design, and collaboration tools (such as collaborative word-processors, digital whiteboards, web-based wireframing and prototyping tools) in the federal government. Our agency partners may not have access to these same tools, or may be prohibited from using them they way we do (for example, they may be able to video chat, but may be unable to share their screen). We’re never afraid of ditching software for good ol’ sticky notes, or pencil and paper.
