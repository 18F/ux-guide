# Tailor the approach

Lean UX is a collaborative, outcome-focused product development and project management philosophy and process. It requires cross disciplinary teams to build, test and refine products throughout multiple iterations.  These teams focus on outcomes (the changes in user behavior you want to see) not outputs (for example, features, functionality, colors).
