Lean UX is a collaborative, outcome-focused product development and project management philosophy and process. It requires cross disciplinary teams to build, test and refine products throughout multiple iterations.  These teams focus on outcomes (the changes in user behavior you want to see) not outputs (for example, features, functionality, colors).  

## Lean Product Principles

- **Outcomes, not outputs.** Focus on outcomes — the changes in user behavior you want to see — rather than specific features.
- **Learn and respond.** Think of your project as a series of experiments you're conducting in close collaboration with your users. Each experiment informs the next, so that you’re always building on the things that bring you closer to your desired outcomes and removing or adjusting things that are not helping you reach your goals.
- **Cross-disciplinary teams.** Teams should be cross-disciplinary, closely integrated, and include the partner product owner as an active design participant.
- **Build shared understanding.** “Strive toward shared understanding at all times. Shared understanding is the collective knowledge of the team that builds up over time as they work together It is a rich understanding of our partners, their products, and users.” (Lean UX, Jeff Gothelf) This will give you more diverse perspectives and inputs, help reveal potential problems much earlier, and ensure everyone on the team understands the intended goals, which translates into informed discussions and decisions at every level.
- **Make assumptions explicit.** Make your assumptions explicit, and test the riskiest or most critical assumptions as early as possible.
- **Keep experiments light.** So that you can move quickly and don't build too much investment in a particular solution.
- **Prioritization is your friend.** Ruthless and ongoing prioritization is essential to keep your efforts lean and focused.
- **Always think problem first.** It’s critical to uncover what problem(s) are plaguing the user(s) in order to explore and experiment with solutions throughout our process. Work with the stakeholders to define and prioritize specific  problem(s) that the project will attempt to resolve. 


## Lean UX Methods

These design methods can help guide your research with both stakeholders and possible end users:

Contextual inquiry
Bodystorming
Stakeholder and user interviews
Journey mapping
Cognitive walkthroughs
KJ method
Heuristic analysis

Your goal is three-fold:

1. Identify and more deeply understand the challenge facing the organization and its stakeholders;
1. Identify the people you believe could be most helped by your solution; and,
1. Explore the problem, context, behaviors, and motivations of the people (your intended users).

For example:

**The challenge:** the United States has high unemployment rate and the growth in jobs is for highly skilled workers. We need more citizens who can meet that demand, and we have evidence that college educated workers are more employed and more employable.
**The people:** High school graduates and adults without a degree
**The problem:** Prospective college students lack information about the potential economic outcomes of a college degree, and also lack information that would lead them to be able to select which college is right for them.

Lean product design may change how you do UX research. Some UX practitioners are used to writing big reports at the conclusion of a single research phase. Here, iteration and learning over repeated experiments is valued over breadth of research. Document the results of your hypothesis test clearly and concisely so you can share them quickly with your team, learn from them, and devise another experiment.

For example, the College Scorecard project developed paper prototypes to validate early ideas about a mobile website to help prospective college students make decisions.


## Problem Statement

Gather your research and use it to create a problem statement. Describe ways that you will know (or measure) when you have solved the problem.

Your turn: Write your project’s statement in the following format:

We have observed that [product/service/organization] isn’t meeting [these goals/needs], which is causing [this adverse effect]. How might we improve so that our product/service/team/organization is more successful based on [these measurable criteria]?

If you have trouble writing a narrow problem statement, brainstorm all the project’s possible goals, needs, and measurable criteria first. Then work as a group to select the most important ones and build your problem statement from there. This process may reveal multiple problem statements. Your team will need to work to figure out which problem to pursue, and how to scope the statement so there are some constraints around what the team is taking on.

The first stage of any project is to do research to discover problems that need solving.

## Identify Assumptions
Your goal is to identify the challenges both groups face and the relationship between the two groups. Focus on the problems stakeholders have, not on potential solutions.
