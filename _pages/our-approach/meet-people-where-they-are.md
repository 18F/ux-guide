Meeting people where they're at helps them realize user-centered design as not just a pragmatic tool for service delivery, but a practicable one. This encourages short-term participation and long-term sustainability. 

We fundamentally meet people where they’re at by viewing them as co-creators of, rather than subjects to, our design process. We are especially mindful of our partner team's:

- Ability to participate
- Design maturity
- Remote friendliness
- Access to tools
- Consideration of outputs and outcomes
- Policy requirements


## Ability to participate

Partner participation is essential to our [team principle]({{site.baseurl}}/our-approach/values-and-principles}) of training design advocates. But just because an agency enters into an agreement with 18F doesn’t mean that their staff is willing and able to participate throughout our engagement. 

At a high level, we encourage participation by:
- Building trust (for example, with [stakeholder interviews](https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/06/20/build-empathy-with-stakeholder-interviews-part-1-preparation/))
- Respecting people’s time and expertise
- Respecting our partner agency’s culture (beliefs, norms, etc.)
- Demonstrating a willingness to being transformed by the work
- Clarifying our purpose (for example, with a problem statement)
- Using plain language, and sharing understanding whenever possible


We assume that people are: 
- Well-intentioned
- Creative
- Competent
- Accountable
- Responsible
- Fallible

A partner’s ability to participate will inevitably affect our day-to-day work. We are honest and transparent whenever we feel that our partners are not participating as much as we need them to be.


## Design maturity

Many agencies choose to work with 18F so that they can build a product or service while also adopting our user-centered approach. As a consequence, our engagements often begin with us thinking about questions related to design maturity such as:

- What is our partner agency’s research awareness and ability? 
- How often does our partner team prototype new ideas?
- How often does our partner team engage in critique?

Getting a sense of our partner’s design maturity helps us to incorporate lightweight instructional activities into our work to help our partners level up their design practice. Over time, we might engage with agency leadership to clarify the long-term role of, or need for, design. This may lead to our:
- Skilling up someone in-house
- Helping to hire someone in-house
- Partnering with a design-mature vendor


## Remote friendliness

18F is a remote-first team for many reasons. For example, being remote-first allows us  to hire people who would not traditionally join government or move to DC, and it allows us to include a broader cross-sampling of people when conducting design research. Being remote-first requires that we maintain [a number of remote-friendly practices](https://18f.gsa.gov/2015/10/15/best-practices-for-distributed-teams/).

The majority of agencies we partner with are not remote-first teams. Therefore, at the beginning of every engagement it’s helpful to ask:
- What’s the highest fidelity way for us to communicate? (We prefer video calls)
- What accommodations will we need to work (hold meetings, design studios, usability tests, synthesis exercises, etc.) in a remote-friendly way?
- Which activities are better held in person? (For example, kickoff meetings)

While we’re vocal proponents of remote work, we understand that some situations will require that we show up in person. For example, we leave our laptops behind whenever we visit [secure compartmentalized information facilities (SCIFs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitive_Compartmented_Information_Facility).


## Access to collaboration tools

18F has fairly unique access to web-based collaboration software, including digital whiteboards, wireframing, and prototyping tools. Our agency partners may not have access to these tools, or may be prohibited from using them they way we do. For example, they may be able to video chat, but may be unable to share their screen. 

In the absence of access to shared collaboration tools, we’re always prepared to:
- Use real sticky notes instead of digital ones
- Use pencil and paper rather than digital sketches (for example, [paper prototyping](https://www.nngroup.com/reports/paper-prototyping-training-video/))
- Use our own tools to render our partner’s intent (for example, by sketching or prototyping something they describe to us over the phone)

We also occasionally help our partner agency prompt the conversations by which they can procure the tools we use at 18F.


## Security and privacy

A big part of what it means to develop government digital services is managing risk. 18F maintains a number of platforms, such as [Federalist](https://federalist.18f.gov/) and [Cloud.gov](https://cloud.gov/), that make it easy for our teams to manage risk throughout the design process. As things move closer to production, we might help our partners [obtain an Authority to Operate (ATO)](https://before-you-ship.18f.gov/ato/).
Additionally, 18F’s design research program shapes how we collect and share information about people (see our [design research privacy guidelines]({{site.baseurl}}/research/privacy)). In helping our agency partners to practice design research, we may prompt conversations with their:
- Privacy office
- Office of General Counsel
- Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA) Desk Officer


## Balancing outputs and outcomes

While we’re big proponents of lean, political realities might require that we provide a specified deliverable by a certain date. To help levelset, we can start by asking:
- What are our user needs?
- What are our stakeholder needs?
- Is this work tied to any publicly made promises or deadlines?
- Are any individuals being held accountable for **outputs** (for example, procuring a new HR system) instead of **outcomes** (for example, making it easier for people to request sick leave)—and how might we shift that accountability metric?

## Policy
Government-led design is complex. In some cases, we find that some of decisions we thought were ours to make have already been made for us. In other cases, policy materially shapes the design process. For example, while building the new FEC.gov 18F conducted usability testing to see how our proposed design changes might affect the site’s usability. If the team wanted to change the forms by which campaigns send information to the FEC, however, the team might be legally required to solicit public feedback over a multi-month period.

As we go about this work, we need to ask:

- Which design decisions are we considering?
- Which policies apply to our proposed design decisions?
- Which aspects of the design are required by policy?
- Which aspects of the design process are required by policy? (For example, which changes will require us to place a notice in the Federal Register?)
- Whose permission will be required if we need a policy exception?
