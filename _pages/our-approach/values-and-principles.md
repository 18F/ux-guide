We believe that good design helps government better serve the public. 18F UX designers help agencies in providing more effective services by improving interactions between government agencies and the people they serve. Together, we’re helping build a 21st century government that works for all.

An essential element of design is collaboration. This document exists to help our cross-functional teams and our agency partners better understand the values and principles that guide our approach.


## Values

We value:
- Understanding people’s needs
- Reducing the cost of improving experiences
- Impact measurement
- The trust this work requires
- Design know-how in government


## Principles

The following principles guide our team in meeting [18F’s mission](https://18f.gsa.gov/about/#our-mission) of transforming how the U.S. government builds and buys digital services.


### We start with user needs

We always begin with identifying the needs of the people our partners serve. Through first-hand research, we explore how to best meet those needs. We seek to first understand who we are designing for then figure out how deliver effective solutions within our partner’s constraints. By starting with user needs, we can see what needs are outside our current limitations and work on changing those limits.


### We iterate to learn

We deliver early and often by building something small, learning by validating with real people, and iterate through a build, test, and learn cycle of increasing fidelity.

Quick feedback loops with users and stakeholders keep the cost of change low and mean little mistakes don’t become big failures.

Holding a flexible vision of our product’s future is critical. We inform product and design decisions on what we learn from data and direct conversations with users. We prototype ideas and put them in front of real people, and do frequent rounds of research to give our teams the evidence to make better decisions.


### We promote inclusion

Good government-led design serves all the people within an agency's mandate. To do this, we promote diversity and inclusion throughout our research and design by looking for those affected by previous design decisions who were not represented when those decisions were made. Having a team with varied life experience and technology usage helps us create more accessible products and services.


### We design together

We work collaboratively, across disciplines to create a shared understanding of the problems we’re solving and the solutions we’re proposing. 

We share our work in progress, not just work when it’s done. Working directly together increases the velocity of iterative process and promotes real agility 

Active conversation reduces the need for abstraction and artifacts and improves the quality of the team’s work through constant refinement. Design’s value is made more apparent through this participation.


### We train advocates

Our partners and stakeholders are experts in their field. Designing alongside them allows us a glimpse into their expertise and them into ours. The shared understanding this work builds allows us to recommend next steps and them to advocate for better design practices to their colleagues. This advocacy for human-centered design practices—specific to the people they serve—lasts long after our partnership ends.


### We finish with user needs

We accept that a goal has been achieved when we validate — via design research — that users can accomplish that goal. We believe a combination of qualitative and quantitative research with real users is necessary to accurately understand this.
