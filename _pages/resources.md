## Design

### Collaboration

Doing UX at 18F can involve working with Content and Visual Designers, or people in our [Acquisition](https://handbook.18f.gov/acqstack/), [Product Management](https://handbook.18f.gov/product/) and [Engineering](https://handbook.18f.gov/engineering/) Chapters. Read their pages in the [TTS/18F Handbook](https://handbook.18f.gov/) for more information.


18F/TTS staff can also participate in local communities of practice in by joining (18F/TTS access only):

- [Content guild (#g-content)](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/g-content)
- [Accessibility guild (#g-accessibility)](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/g-accessibility/)
- [Research guild (#g-research)](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/g-research)

### Microrequests

If you’re in need of a particular skill — help with a presentation or design deliverable; writing and content strategy; or development tasks — 18F’s microrequest staffing team can provide support. You can request assistance from 18F colleagues for help on billable projects in the [#microrequests (18F/TTS access only](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=microrequests)) channel. Each discipline is represented at any time in the channel.

Any billable project work is eligible for assistance via a microrequest. The only limitation is that microrequest tasks must typically take fewer than 8 hours of work a week, over no more than 3 weeks, for the person providing the assistance. You may post non-billable requests in the [#helpwanted (18F/TTS access only](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=helpwanted)) channel.

For more information, visit the [Microrequests](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/microrequests/) page in the [TTS Handbook](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/).

### Presenting the work
We most commonly share our work via presentations. These presentations can vary widely based on the audience. Here are a few presentation-building tips:

* Utilize our [18F-branded templates](https://brand.18f.gov/templates/) to maintain consistency and save time.
* The presentation deck should tell a compelling story and be easy to read. Make sure to include enough content so those not able to attend the presentation can view the deck later and understand what you’re aiming to communicate. Refer to this presentation on [How to design a better deck (18F/GSA access only](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WMbN1feG1bMhaFx5YbXoYUTE7xgZdMewMaQBZeL3YmA/edit#slide=id.g58dd554fac_0_397)) for additional pointers and guidance.
* Check out the [Project resources folder (18F/GSA access only](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1L9qqS6-b-emvlWJ4JPCG58LW62bbV361)) for reusable content and templates; browse [previous 18F Path Analysis project artifacts](https://github.com/18F/project-artifacts/blob/master/projects.md) for inspiration; or view the [Design wiki](https://github.com/18F/Design-Wiki/wiki) for additional examples.
* Consider making a [microrequest](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/microrequests/) if you’re unsure how to articulate or visualize an idea.
* Feel free to include references or links to further reading at the end of your presentation.
