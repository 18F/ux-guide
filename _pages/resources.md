## Design

### Collaboration

Doing UX at 18F can involve working with Content and Visual Designers, or people in our [Acquisition](https://handbook.18f.gov/acqstack/), [Product Management](https://handbook.18f.gov/product/) and [Engineering](https://handbook.18f.gov/engineering/) Chapters. Read their pages in the [TTS/18F Handbook](https://handbook.18f.gov/) for more information.


You can also participate in local communities of practice in by joining:

- [Content guild (#g-content)](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/g-content)
- [Accessibility guild (#g-accessibility)](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/g-accessibility/)
- [Research guild (#g-research)](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/g-research)

### Microrequests

If you’re in need of a particular skill — help with a presentation or design deliverable; writing and content strategy; or development tasks — 18F’s microrequest staffing team can provide support. You can request assistance from 18F colleagues for help on billable projects in the [#microrequests](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=microrequests) channel. Each discipline is represented at any time in the channel. 

Any billable project work is eligible for assistance via a microrequest. The only limitation is that microrequest tasks must typically take fewer than 8 hours of work a week, over no more than 3 weeks, for the person providing the assistance. You may post non-billable requests in the [#helpwanted](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/app_redirect?channel=helpwanted) channel. 

For more information, visit the [Microrequests](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/microrequests/) page in the [TTS Handbook](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/).

### Presenting the work
We most commonly share our work via presentations. These presentations can vary widely based on the audience. Here are a few presentation-building tips:

* Utilize our [18F-branded templates](https://brand.18f.gov/templates/) to maintain consistency and save time. 
* The presentation should tell a compelling story, be easy to read, but include enough content so others can read it and understand what you’re aiming to communicate. Refer to this presentation on [How to design a better deck](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1WMbN1feG1bMhaFx5YbXoYUTE7xgZdMewMaQBZeL3YmA/edit#slide=id.g58dd554fac_0_397) for additional pointers and guidance. 
* Check out the [Project resources folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1L9qqS6-b-emvlWJ4JPCG58LW62bbV361) for reusable content and templates; browse [project artifacts from previous 18F engagements](https://github.com/18F/project-artifacts/blob/master/projects.md) for inspiration; or view the [Design wiki](https://github.com/18F/Design-Wiki/wiki) for additional examples. 
* Consider making a [microrequest](https://handbook.tts.gsa.gov/microrequests/) if you’re unsure how to articulate or visualize an idea.
* Feel free to include references or links to further reading at the end of your presentation.
