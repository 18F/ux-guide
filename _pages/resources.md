## Design

### Collaboration
Doing UX at 18F can involve working with Content and Visual Designers, or people in our [Acquisition](https://handbook.18f.gov/acqstack/), [Strategy](https://handbook.18f.gov/strategy/), [Product Management](https://handbook.18f.gov/product/) and [Engineering](https://handbook.18f.gov/engineering/) Chapters. Read their pages in the [TTS/18F Handbook](https://handbook.18f.gov/) for more information.

You can also participate in local communities of practice in by joining the [Content guild (#g-content)](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/g-content), [Analytics guild (#g-analytics)](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/g-analytics/), [Frontend guild (#g-frontend)](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/g-frontend), [Accessibility guild (#g-accessibility)](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/g-accessibility/), [Agile guild (#g-agile)](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/g-agile/), and [Research guild (#g-research)](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/g-research).

### Labs
Whenever you’re in need of a particular skill — help polishing a presentation; content design; or a front-end development — 18F’s internal labs can provide support. The development, writing, and design labs are virtual centers, staffed by 18F colleagues from various teams to provide personalized help within each discipline. Any 18F project is eligible for help (with preference towards billable work as it aids in our goal towards cost recoverability). For more information, visit the [Writing lab](https://handbook.18f.gov/writing-lab/#portfolio-of-services), [Design lab](https://github.com/18F/design-lab), and [Dev lab](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/CDE5DU7QC/) (on Slack).
