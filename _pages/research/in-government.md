In conducting design research, our goal is to help the teams we partner with become more expert at accounting for and understanding user needs, and to help our partners benchmark and improve their user experience. That said, because government-led design research is relatively new, 18F works closely with our partners to ensure that our research aligns with their existing rules and norms for collecting user feedback. With each project, we aim to design research that fits the needs and constraints of the partner, product, and team. This helps broaden awareness that design research is not just a pragmatic tool for government service delivery, but a practicable one as well.


## Feedback fast and slow

Imagine two identical restaurants, the Government Grille and the Design Diner. Each establishment serves a single, signature dish. Each is trying to provide their patrons with the best possible dining experience. The only difference is their approach.

Chefs at the Government Grille take an approach rooted in numbers gathered over longer periods of time. They derive the recipe for their signature dish by conducting market research, and then design their kitchen to produce that dish at the lowest possible cost. Whenever the chefs want to change their recipe, they share their proposed changes on the front door of the restaurant for months, for public comment.

In keeping with their statistical approach, the Government Grille does not employ many wait staff empowered to directly speak with patrons about their dining experience. This isn’t to say that the Government Grille doesn’t care about that experience — on their way out, patrons can fill out exit surveys that include five-point scales.

Chefs at the Design Diner take a different approach, one rooted in qualitative methods and faster feedback loops. Before deciding on the recipe for their signature dish, chefs at the Design Diner visit local restaurants. They speak directly with patrons to better understand their dietary habits and anticipated wait times. Based on that first-hand knowledge, chefs at the Design Diner make frequent, informed guesses at which recipe and kitchen setup will please their patrons most.

In keeping with their qualitative approach, wait staff at the Design Diner are encouraged to speak directly with patrons about their dining experience, and to share patron feedback directly with chefs. They also use five-point exit surveys.

Though this metaphor oversimplifies important aspects, the point is this: both government agencies and design-led organizations want to produce great products and services, and to provide great experiences. They just tend to go about it a bit differently. Government agencies employ both long and short feedback loops (for example, collecting feedback on proposed changes for months in advance of making them, and exit surveys). Design-led organizations tend to prefer short feedback loops.

18F takes a proactive approach to customer service. For example, while [building the new FEC.gov](https://18f.gsa.gov/2017/05/30/the-new-fec/) we conducted frequent [remote usability tests](https://18f.gsa.gov/2018/11/14/introduction-to-remote-moderated-usability-testing-part-1/) to understand how our proposed design decisions could affect the site’s navigability, usability, etc. That said, there are times when it is difficult to solicit feedback quickly. For example, while updating the FEC’s website is as simple as changing a few lines of code, updating the labels on its digital forms might **require** that the Commission solicit public feedback over a multi-month period. 

18F UX designers need to be mindful of government rules and norms, and design our research to position both ourselves and our partners for long-term success. To return to the restaurant metaphor, our goal as 18F UX designers isn’t limited to helping the agencies we partner with to identify and improve the recipe of their signature dish; it must also includes working with our partners to set up their kitchen and to empower their wait staff in creating and responding to feedback loops in perpetuity.

## Research design

[Executive Order 13571](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2011/04/27/executive-order-13571-streamlining-service-delivery-and-improving-custom) (part of [this list of Federal customer service requirements](https://digital.gov/resources/government-customer-service-policies-requirements-1993-to-present/)) directs agencies to create “mechanisms to solicit customer feedback on government services,” but leaves it up to agencies to design their feedback mechanisms. At 18F we consider many of the same elements as non-government researchers when planning research. However, to better align our research with the rules and norms of our agency partners, and to better account for [legal & privacy](#) and [ethics & bias](#) considerations, we must give special consideration to foundational aspects of research practice such as:

- Recruiting,
- Incentives,
- Informed consent processes,
- Research methods and modes, and
- Data practices (data collection, minimization, processing, and management).

The information in this guide is provided as useful starting-points for getting comfortable conducting research on 18F projects. They are not the only way to do research. 18F UX designers should anticipate introducing these ideas to our agency partners, and engaging with partners in discussion about these ideas. If you yourself have questions, ask your supervisor, ask your project lead, or join the research guild ([#g-research on Slack](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/C03JK2KH8)).
