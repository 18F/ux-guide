Our goal in conducting design research is to help the agencies we partner with become more expert at understanding user needs and improving their product or services’ user experience. We work closely with our partners to tailor our approach to research so that it better aligns with their existing rules and norms for collecting feedback. This helps broaden awareness that design research is not just a *pragmatic* tool for government service delivery, but a *practicable* one as well.


## Feedback fast and slow


Imagine two restaurants, the Government Grille and the Design Diner. Each establishment serves a single, signature dish. Each is trying to provide their patrons with the best possible dining experience. The only difference is their approach.

Chefs at the Government Grille prefer to gather numbers over long periods of time. They derive the recipe for their signature dish, for example, by conducting extensive market research. They design their kitchen to produce that dish at the lowest possible cost. Whenever the chefs want to change their recipe, they post their proposed changes on the front door of the restaurant for months, for public comment.

The Government Grille does not employ many wait staff empowered to directly speak with people about their dining experience. But that isn’t to say that Grille chefs don’t care about the experience they provide; on their way out, patrons are provided with exit surveys that include five-point scales.

Chefs at the Design Diner prefer to collect qualitative data over short periods of time. Before deciding on the recipe for their signature dish, chefs at the Design Diner visit local restaurants. They speak directly with patrons to better understand their dietary habits and anticipated wait times. Based on that first-hand knowledge, chefs at the Design Diner make frequent, informed guesses at which recipe and kitchen setup will please their patrons most.

Wait staff at the Design Diner are encouraged to speak directly with patrons about their dining experience, and to share patron feedback directly with chefs. The Design Diner also uses five-point exit surveys.

Though this metaphor oversimplifies some important aspects, the point is this: both government agencies and designers want to provide great products and services, great experiences. They just go about it differently. Government agencies tend to rely on long feedback loops (for example, in collecting feedback on proposed changes for months in advance of making them), whereas designers often prefer short ones (for example, quickly gathering insights to inform their decisions, and validating those decisions once they’re made).

This can play out in interesting ways on 18F engagements across government. For example, while [building the new FEC.gov](https://18f.gsa.gov/2017/05/30/the-new-fec/) we conducted frequent [remote usability tests](https://18f.gsa.gov/2018/11/14/introduction-to-remote-moderated-usability-testing-part-1/) to understand how our proposed designs might affect the site’s navigability, usability, etc. But while updating the FEC’s website might be as simple as changing a few lines of code, updating the labels on its digital forms might **require** the Commission to solicit public feedback over a multi-month period. 

## Research design

[Executive Order 13571](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/the-press-office/2011/04/27/executive-order-13571-streamlining-service-delivery-and-improving-custom) (part of [a host of Federal customer service requirements](https://digital.gov/resources/government-customer-service-policies-requirements-1993-to-present/)) directs agencies to create “mechanisms to solicit customer feedback on government services,” but leaves it up to agencies to design their feedback mechanisms. At 18F we consider many of the same elements as non-government researchers when [planning research](/research/planning/). However, to better align our research with the rules and norms of our agency partners — and to better account for legal, privacy, ethics, and bias considerations — we give special consideration to foundational aspects of research practice such as:

- Recruiting,
- Incentives,
- Informed consent processes,
- Research methods and modes, and
- Data practices (data collection, minimization, processing, and management).

18F UX designers regularly engage with our partners in discussions about how to make foundational aspects of research work in government. If you yourself have questions, ask your supervisor, ask your project lead, or join the research guild ([#g-research on Slack](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/messages/C03JK2KH8)) and ask your colleagues.
