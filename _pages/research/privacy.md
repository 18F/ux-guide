18F protects participant privacy through research practices rooted in building and maintaining trust: people who trust us (for example, to keep their information confidential) are more likely to share comprehensive and accurate accounts of their experience.

[OMB Circular A-130](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/OMB/circulars/a130/a130revised.pdf) defines PII as “information that can be used to distinguish or trace an individual’s identity, either alone or when combined with other information that is linked or linkable to a specific individual.” PII is contextually dependent. Social Security Numbers, recorded voice, and photos and videos depicting individuals—including interviews or usability tests—are always considered PII. Email addresses, phone numbers, and mailing addresses are sometimes considered PII, and when presented in combination with a first name often become PII. Because every collection of PII increases the risk of future privacy violations, it’s ideal to refrain from collecting PII at all (for example, by analyzing the data collected via [GSA’s Digital Analytics Program](https://digital.gov/dap/)).

The Privacy Act of 1974 provides protection to individuals by ensuring that PII collected by Federal agencies is limited to that which is legally authorized and necessary and that such PII is protected against anticipated threats to security or integrity which could result in substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience or unfairness to the individual. The Privacy Act requires that Privacy Act Notices appear whenever agencies collect PII from individuals in order to allow for informed consent.

18F complies with the Privacy Act through our use of [GSA’s Privacy Act Statement for Design Research](https://www.gsa.gov/reference/gsa-privacy-program/privacy-act-statement-for-design-research) and by following the data practices outlined in [GSA's Privacy Impact Assessment for Design Research](https://www.gsa.gov/cdnstatic/20181022%20-%20Design%20Research%20PIA_posted%20version.pdf). You should familiarize yourself with both of these documents, and feel comfortable explaining their implications for research participants; both documents are included in 18F’s [informed consent process](). GSA Staff should also see [this presentation](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/files/U9KLLKS4W/FCSFWBZD3/researchguildprivacytalk091218.mp4) from GSA Privacy Office’s to the [TTS Research Guild](https://github.com/18F/g-research/), and [this presentation](https://drive.google.com/a/gsa.gov/open?id=1MM6tNlFc-Iwgw_cCUw_0KS8oQMS-FEN7sYftPQLmLAg) for tips for protecting PII in design research.

## Guidelines

Design researchers should maintain participant privacy while also encouraging the broader team’s involvement. This is a balancing act. If you were to broadly share (that is, outside your core team) recordings of every interview you conduct during a round of stakeholder interviews (note: we don’t do this), for example, you would risk violating your stakeholders’ privacy. 

The following guidelines, drawn from our [Privacy Impact Assessment for Design Research](https://www.gsa.gov/cdnstatic/20181022%20-%20Design%20Research%20PIA_posted%20version.pdf), help us protect privacy and maintain trust. This list isn’t exhaustive, but it’s a good place to start:

- Seek introductions from key stakeholders before conducting interviews with stakeholders; build rapport with research participants in advance of the research activity (for example, by emailing or telephoning them to answer questions and conduct tech checks) 
- Whenever you collect PII, store it digitally on [agency-approved systems for PII](https://www.gsa.gov/reference/gsa-privacy-program/systems-of-records-privacy-act/system-of-records-notices-sorns-privacy-act); actively remove access to PII from anyone not on your project team; and always place paper documents with PII in locked file cabinets
- Store administrative data (for example, contact information collected during research participant recruiting) separate from study data (for example, recorded video of a usability test); share research-related records on a need-to-know basis
- Inform and collect the voluntary consent of anyone who participates in your moderated research; disclose the purposes of your research, the sponsoring agency, etc. while being mindful not to prime participants and introduce [bias](/research/bias/)
- Ensure that your use of unmoderated forms of design research (for example, using web analytics or monitoring forum traffic) are covered by or comply with applicable privacy policies
- Use pseudonyms (for example, “Participant 1”) when naming your recordings, transcribing audio files, or writing reports; and de-identify recordings before subjecting them to broadly shared analysis or synthesis
- Requesting research participant permission before incorporating any PII or attributable information (for example, quotes with attribution) into shared analysis, reports or presentations; and be [mindful of contextual integrity when presenting research](https://thesocietypages.org/cyborgology/2017/03/12/context-integrity-and-consent-in-presenting-research/)
- Delete study data whenever we conclude a round of research, and ask that anyone we’ve shared recordings with to do the same
