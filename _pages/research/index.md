The Research section is the foundation of the 18F User Experience Guide and is core to our work at 18F. This section covers everything you need to know about conducting ethical, inclusive, and unbiased research with people from start to finish and includes information about privacy and storing PII as well as legal considerations such as PRA and compensation.
