**With each project, we aim to design user research that fits the needs and constraints of the partner, product, and team.**

Some practices have emerged as norms that can be useful starting-points for getting comfortable conducting research on 18F projects. This guide isn't about *the one right way* to do research â€” think of it as a list of tips, resources, and expectations for what "user research" means at 18F.

User research at 18F is special for a few reasons, including:

- Much of our research is conducted remotely, because we work in distributed teams spread across the U.S.
- We work within the bounds and guidance of federal laws and regulations, including the [Paperwork Reduction Act (PRA)](https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-104publ13/html/PLAW-104publ13.htm).
- Because we want our partnerships with agencies to expand the ranks of advocates and practitioners of user research in government, we are always teaching and coaching as we go.
