Design research explores possibilities, tests assumptions, and reduces risk by actively and systematically engaging with the world. It includes:

- Qualitative and quantitative methods
- Investigating tools and systems
- Interacting with members of the public

All 18F teams do design research. Design involves continuous decision making, and those decisions are made better when they’re informed by end-user perspectives. As a result, we’re committed to continuous research. Rather than seeing designed products or services themselves as the goal, we view the products or services we’re designing as the result of our continued effort to identify, understand, and address user needs.
