Design research explores possibilities, tests assumptions, and reduces risk by actively and systematically engaging with the world. It includes qualitative and quantitative methods, investigating tools and systems, and interacting with members of the public.

All 18F teams do design research. Design involves continuous decision-making, and those decisions are made better when they’re informed by end user perspectives. As a result, we’re committed to continuous research. Rather than seeing designed products or services themselves as the goal, we view the products or services we’re designing as the result of our continued effort to identify, understand, and address user needs.
