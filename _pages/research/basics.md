Design research can feel overwhelming, even to people who’ve done it before! Let’s agree on some basics before we jump in.

## Research is a team sport
Design research helps you systematically explore possibilities and answer questions. Because a collaborative approach to research increases the team’s overall empathy and efficiency, research is best practiced as a team sport. 
Everyone has a role to play here. The following roles are not mutually exclusive; they’re simply collections of related tasks. Anyone on the team can play multiple roles:
- **Author** — Contributes to the research design, including research questions and interview guides or protocols.
- **Recruiter** — Facilitates finding and scheduling users to learn from. 
- **Coordinator/scheduler** — Sets and manages the logistics (times, places, stakeholders) of the research.
- **Interviewer/moderator** — Facilitates the interview or activity. This person should be able to give their full attention to the participant(s) and should not be responsible for capturing responses.
- **Notetaker/recorder** — Documents what happens during the research (e.g., during a usability test).
- **Observer** — This is the default role for teammates who are new to research. Observers should listen to interviews, observe usability tests, etc. without influencing the research. If it’s a remote test, turn off your microphone to mute the keyboard noises. 
- **Documenter** — Communicates research findings.

In addition to adopting roles, it can be useful to nominate someone as a [research lead](/research/lead): a person ultimately responsible for planning research, recruiting participants, maintaining quality, etc. 

## Research types
On any given project, you should only perform the research activities that you believe will best inform the design decisions you anticipate. Broadly speaking, 18F research falls into three categories:

**Foundational research**
Foundational research is the research you do before you know the problem(s) you’re solving. This is primarily purpose of Path Analysis engagements: to get a baseline understanding of the problem space you’re working in and the people you’re serving. This research often results in a [problem statement](https://github.com/18F/path-analysis/blob/master/approach.md#2-draft-a-problem-statement). 

**Generative research**
Generative research helps you better frame the problem(s) you’ll solve, spark new ideas, and reveal opportunities. Generative research helps you ask: What are my users’ goals, behaviors, and pain points? What is the broader context they’re operating in? What elements are important to my problem space?

**Evaluative research**
Evaluative research tests assumptions, hypotheses, and the efficacy of design solutions (such as prototypes). This research helps you ask: Am I building the right thing? Does it meet user needs? Is it easy to use?
