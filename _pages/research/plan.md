Research planning is crucial for making the most of users’ time. It often takes 1-2 weeks of dedicated time, and can include many conversations about goals, expectations, and logistics.

## Write a research plan

The research plan should help the whole team get to a shared understanding of what you're hoping to accomplish and how you'll get there. Feel free to utilize our [research plan template]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/research-plan/).

This document should make clear:

- What big questions are you trying to answer? What should this research help you do?
- What kinds of research will do you? What methods will you use?
- How many people are you hoping to learn from? This can be a wide range, but should help set expectations for scale; 5-8 interviews is a very different undertaking than 30+ sessions. For explaining _why_ 5-8 usability sessions can be enough, this article is always helpful: [Why You Only Need to Test with 5 Users](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/).
- How will you find people to learn from? What’s the plan for recruiting them? Sometimes you’ll want to start on recruiting even before your plan is finalized, because it’s a common timeline torpedo.
  + todo: Expand on recruiting, esp what to do if recruiting doesn't go as planned/if you can't find enough participants. I.e. get contacts through the partner agency, get contacts through previous participants, email listservs, etc.
- When do you know you’re done with this round/sprint of research?

**Here are a few research methods we use a lot at 18F:**

_Choose research methods that are appropriate for your product and project; this is just to note what we use most often._

- Generative [stakeholder or user interviews](https://methods.18f.gov/#stakeholder-and-user-interviews) (remember to be clear about which you’re doing, and target questions and synthesis accordingly)
- Remote [contextual inquiry](https://methods.18f.gov/#contextual-inquiry) or [usability testing](https://methods.18f.gov/#usability-testing)
    - [Heuristics for quality usability testing](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qfGp3H1pdOlNbMYuJNQGyBIkpOcQErduDAl0adv1X-w/edit)
- Brief in-person usability sessions through intercept testing

## Write a script to guide interviewers

It's important to have a script (also called a research protocol) for several reasons: it helps keep sessions consistent, ensures that multiple people on the project team can conduct interviews, and serves as an example for future research efforts to build on.

Most research scripts include these sections:

- Introductory preamble
    - Remind them that this is not a test of them, and there are no wrong answers
    - Remind them that this is voluntary, and they can call it at any point if they no longer want to participate
- Consent for note-taking or recording
    - Tell them how you’ll use the notes
    - Tell them whether you’ll attribute any quotes
    - Consent form, if needed (for remote sessions, this likely needs to be handled in pre-interview correspondence)
- What questions to ask
- Potential follow-up questions
- Concluding thanks, questions, or invitations to follow up

## Plan to include partners and team members

Figure out who will be participating in research, and work with them as you prepare to create shared expectations. If you have partners or team members who are new to research, make time to walk them through the plan and script so they can ask questions and understand what to expect. If you expect them to take notes, train them on research note-taking! If you have multiple notetakers/observers, talk about how to work together and avoid stepping on toes during note-taking.

## Prepare materials

For some research (for instance, usability testing), you’ll need to work with other designers, developers, and writers to build a prototype to put in front of users. These materials should be identified in the research plan, so that the team can be ready with the design and functionality you’re hoping to test. You’ll also need a plan to publish or share the prototype with users (for instance, a link to send or a print-out).
