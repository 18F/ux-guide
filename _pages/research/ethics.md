The following principles exist to support 18F researchers as we create useful insights. Research affords us opportunities to both interact with people and explore the boundaries of what’s possible. Ethical principles encourage us to reflect on our work and how we decide to go about it. 

**Disclaimer:** These principles are meant to serve in addition to [our basic ethical obligations as public servants](https://www.justice.gov/ncfs/file/761076/download). If you have questions, contact your supervisor, GSA’s Privacy Office or ethics counsel.


## Respect

We respect the cultural norms of the agencies we’re working in. We seek permission from potential research participants as early as possible, and work to minimize any investment on their part before they’ve formally opted-in. We honor people’s opinions and choices. We ensure that anyone who participates in our research does so of their own free will, and that they have enough information to make that decision responsibly. If someone who participates in our research appears uncomfortable, we offer that person the option to skip the subject altogether. We do not correct people during our interviews or usability tests. We ask, *am I treating people as collaborators rather than subjects of the research process?*

## Beneficence

We do our best to further the best interests of the people and country we serve. We avoid actions that might cause harm. We collect informed consent, and work to ensure that nothing changes for our potential research participants if they do not participate in our research. During our research, we collect only the information we need, we control access to raw research data, and keep the focus of our research on people’s needs and useful insights rather than on specific individuals. We actively de-identify research records before subjecting them to shared analysis. We consider what it will mean for our research participants before disclosing our research findings — we share our data on a need-to-know basis. We minimize or remove access to design research-data after it is no longer needed.

## Honesty

Design research should never feel covert or manipulative.  We’re transparent with potential research participants about how we plan to use the data we collect (for example, by sharing a [Privacy Act Notice](https://www.gsa.gov/reference/gsa-privacy-program/privacy-act-statement-for-design-research) in our participant recruiting processes). We’re careful not to mislead participants unless such information might unduly influence their behavior. In those cases we get their permission to either not reveal this information or we only delay sharing it — for example, we might explain after a usability test that our research employed a prototype with example data. We provide clear descriptions of our data practices via our [Privacy Impact Assessment for Design Research](https://www.gsa.gov/cdnstatic/20181022%20-%20Design%20Research%20PIA_posted%20version.pdf).
