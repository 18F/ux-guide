Research affords us with opportunities to both interact with people and explore what’s possible — exciting stuff! The following ethical principles are here to guide us through some of the tougher decisions that this work can bring about. 

**Disclaimer:** These principles are meant to serve in addition to your [basic ethical obligations as public servants](https://www.justice.gov/ncfs/file/761076/download). If you have questions, contact your supervisor, [GSA’s Privacy Office](https://www.gsa.gov/reference/gsa-privacy-program), or [Ethics Legal counsel](https://www.gsa.gov/about-us/organization/office-of-general-counsel/ethics-legal-counsel).


## Respect

We respect the cultural norms of the agencies we work with, and acknowledge the people who participate in our research as the experts of their own experiences. 

#### You should:

- Seek permission from potential research participants as early as possible, and work to minimize any investment on their part before they’ve formally opted-in 
- As much as possible, meet at times and locations convenient for our research participants
- Ensure that anyone who participates in your research does so of their own free will, and that they have enough information to make that decision responsibly 
- Honor people’s opinions and choices. Do not correct people during the course of your research
- If someone uncomfortable with or prefers not to sign a participant agreement, offer them alternative opportunities for them to participate or the option to not participate at all
- If someone who participates in our research appears uncomfortable, offer that person the option to skip the subject altogether or to cease their participation
- Ask, *am I treating people as collaborators rather than subjects of the research process?*


## Responsibility

We have a responsibility to further the best interests of the people and country we collectively serve. We avoid actions that might bring harm to our participants.

#### You should:

- Collect informed consent
- Never record people without their consent
- Work to ensure your potential research participants are not impacted negatively if they don’t participate in your research
- Account for diversity and inclusion in your research recruiting (for example, by specifically recruiting people who use a screen reader to navigate your website)
- Collect only the information you need
- Control access to raw design research-related data
- De-identify research records before subjecting them to shared analysis
- Consider what it will mean for your research participants before disclosing our research findings — share research data only a need-to-know basis. 
- Keep the focus of your research on people’s needs and useful insights rather than on specific individuals
- Minimize or remove access to design research-data after it is no longer needed


## Honesty

Design research should never feel covert or manipulative. We provide clear descriptions of our data practices in our [Privacy Impact Assessment for Design Research](https://www.gsa.gov/cdnstatic/20181022%20-%20Design%20Research%20PIA_posted%20version.pdf).

#### You should:

- Acknowledge that ethics and [bias](https://github.com/18F/ux-guide/blob/master/_pages/research/bias.md) is a part of all research, and actively work to counter it in your [research planning](#)
- Be careful of the conclusions you draw
- Be transparent in conversations with your research participants about how you plan to use the data your collect (for example, by sharing a [Privacy Act Notice](https://www.gsa.gov/reference/gsa-privacy-program/privacy-act-statement-for-design-research)). 
- Be careful not to mislead participants; provide as much information as possible while maintaining the integrity of the research.

These principles draw heavily from IDEO’s *The Little Book of Design Research Ethics.* We also referenced The Department of Health and Human Services’ (HHS) *Belmont Report* in creating this document.
