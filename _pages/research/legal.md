18F accounts for both the Antideficiency Act and the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (PRA) by tailoring our research recruiting processes and our use of incentives. The PRA also shapes the research methods and modes for which we show a preference.


**Disclaimer:** This page summarizes what we’ve learned through continued (and ongoing) conversation with GSA’s Privacy Office and Office of General Counsel. It is intended for internal use. It is shared (in the spirit of open source) to prompt conversations around design research as it relates to the law. GSA has no regulatory authority over any of the laws discussed in this section. Don’t take our word for it.

## The Antideficiency Act

The Antideficiency Act prevents federal agencies from accidentally obligating themselves to pay for products or services. 18F mitigates this risk by clarifying with potential participants throughout our recruiting process that their participation must be made without expectation of payment or compensation. (We never want to hear “Hey, all that free work I gave you? I want to get paid for that.”) This is why, for example, our [participant agreement](https://methods.18f.gov/participant-agreement/) includes the following language:

> **You will not receive payment or compensation for your participation.** You agree to perform all duties associated with your participation in this study during the period of `<project start date>` – `<project end date>` without expectation of payment or compensation.

The Antideficiency Act also shapes our approach to incentives. Although they are commonly used in the private sector, each government agency approaches incentives differently. GSA’s Office of General Counsel (OGC) asks that we not directly pay incentives to research participants. However, some of the agencies we partner with, like the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, have [offered incentives in the past](https://www.cms.gov/Medicare/Quality-Initiatives-Patient-Assessment-Instruments/QualityInitiativesGenInfo/Downloads/Consumer-Usability-Testing-in-Five-State-based-Marketplaces.pdf). 

## The Paperwork Reduction Act

The Paperwork Reduction Act is designed to “maximize the practical utility of and public benefit from information collected by or for the Federal Government.” The PRA is administered by the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs (OIRA) within the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and affects our choice of research methods and modes as well as our research participant recruiting.

### Research methods and modes

Without digging into the details of the PRA too much, 18F researchers comply with the PRA as a result of our overall approach: we conduct our research over short periods of time, with a small number of participants, using [methods](https://methods.18f.gov/) that capture unstructured data. We prefer qualitative methods — for example, contextual inquiries, and semi-structured or unstructured interviews and usability tests — over quantitative methods like surveys and analytics.

In OIRA’s [Flexibilities under the Paperwork Reduction Act for Compliance with Information Collection Requirements](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/inforeg/pra_flexibilities_memo_7_22_16_finalI.pdf) memo, OIRA says that (emphasis added) “OMB does not generally consider facts or opinions obtained through **direct observation** by an employee or agent of the sponsoring agency or through **non-standardized oral communications** in connection with such direct observations to be information under the PRA.” Accordingly, 18F prefers modes of research where we can directly observe and interact with stakeholders and users. You know, like in in-person meetings and video chats.

### Research participant recruiting

18F recruiters, also known as screeners or intercepts, comply with the PRA (per OIRA’s [Social Media, Web-Based Interactive Technologies, and the Paperwork Reduction Act](https://obamawhitehouse.archives.gov/sites/default/files/omb/assets/inforeg/SocialMediaGuidance_04072010.pdf) memo) by not asking people for any information other than their contact information such as name, email address, mailing address, and/or phone number to arrange for further correspondence.

Additionally, 18F recruiters comply with PRA by targeting either one of two groups: everyone or a specific individual. In other words, we cannot exclude people from our research by using language that specifies a specific type of person or group of people.
