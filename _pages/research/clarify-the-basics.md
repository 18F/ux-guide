Design research can feel overwhelming, even to people who’ve done it before! Let’s agree on some basics before we jump in.

## Research is a team activity

Design research helps you systematically explore possibilities and answer questions. Because a collaborative approach to research [increases the team’s overall empathy and efficiency](https://18f.gsa.gov/2016/08/16/what-happens-when-the-whole-team-joins-user-interviews/), research is best practiced as [a team activity](http://www.myddelton.co.uk/blog/user-research-is-a-team-sport). 

The following list outlines research-related activities that will be shared across the entire team:

- **Research design** —  Formulating a research plan, including research questions and interview guides
- **Recruiting** — Finding and qualifying stakeholders and users to learn from 
- **Coordinating/scheduling** — Setting and managing the logistics (times, places, stakeholders) of the research
- **Interviewing/moderating** — Facilitating the interview or activity. This person should be able to give their full attention to the participant(s) and should not be responsible for capturing responses.
- **Note-taking/recording** — Documents what happens during the research (e.g., during a usability test).
- **Observing** — This is the default role for teammates who are new to research. Observers should listen to interviews, observe usability tests, etc. without influencing the research. If it’s a remote test, turn off your microphone to mute the keyboard noises. 
- **Debriefing** — CommunDebriefing — Coming to shared understanding as a team for the individual session. This is usually done immediately after the research activity.
- **Synthesis** — Finding patterns and themes across all research activities. 
- **Reporting** — Capturing and communicating findings from the research to partners and stakeholders.


## Research types

On any given project, you should only perform the research activities that you believe will best inform the design decisions you anticipate. Broadly speaking, 18F research falls into three categories:

#### Foundational research

Foundational research is the research you do to learn about the landscape you’re operating in and articulate the problem(s) you’re solving. It commonly involves stakeholder interviews, desk (or secondary) research, and workshops. This is primarily, though not exclusively, the domain of 18F [Path Analysis](https://github.com/18F/path-analysis) engagements. Foundational research results in a [problem statement](https://github.com/18F/path-analysis/blob/master/approach.md#2-draft-a-problem-statement).

#### Generative research

Generative research helps you better frame the problem(s) you’ll solve, spark new ideas, and reveal opportunities. Generative research helps you ask: What are our users’ goals, behaviors, and pain points? What is their context? How might we address the problems we’ve identified? What might success look like?

#### Evaluative research

Evaluative research tests assumptions, hypotheses, and the efficacy of design solutions, such as prototypes. Evaluative research helps you ask: Am I building the right thing—or, better yet (if it’s done regularly), am I building the thing right? Does it meet user needs? Is it easy to use?

## The process

Learning is rarely linear, but 18F’s research tends to follow an ordered progression. The following steps are repeated as necessary throughout each 18F engagement:
1. Plan. Agree on the questions you want answered, the methods you’ll employ, who’s playing what roles, etc. Prepare interview guides, practice, schedule time, and decide how you’ll recruit and collect informed consent
1. Do. Get the whole team involved, and debrief after each session.
1. Analyze, synthesize, and share. Take stock of the data you’ve collected, look for patterns, write a summary of what you’ve learned, share it broadly, and delete recordings afterward

## The environment

#### Remote
As a distributed team, 18F defaults to remote-friendly ways of working. This gives everyone on our team a chance to participate, and lets us hear from people regardless of their location. We’ve written before about [how to manage a research project remotely](https://18f.gsa.gov/2017/09/27/three-ways-to-manage-research-projects/) and [conduct moderated usability tests remotely](https://18f.gsa.gov/2018/11/14/introduction-to-remote-moderated-usability-testing-part-1/), but our basic advice is:

- **Try to conduct remote research via video conference.** Find out what conferencing platforms your partners and participants have access to. 
- **Use tools, just like in person.** Tools we use commonly for virtual collaboration include Google Docs, Google Sheets, and Murally.
- **Schedule regular co-working time.** Use this time to work together on research plans, draft interview questions, or synthesize findings. Setting this up as a recurring event helps sustain the research effort throughout a project.

#### In-person

With most projects you’ll conduct an in-person kickoff, during which you may have the chance to meet, interview, and conduct activities with stakeholders. If feasible, consider adding [contextual inquiry](https://methods.18f.gov/discover/contextual-inquiry/) into your kick-off activities. Direct user observation will provide firsthand understanding of your stakeholders’ and users’ processes and contexts.

We prefer in-person research when we want to better understand the environment in which users normally interact with a government service. We also prefer in-person research when our participants aren’t especially proficient with, or don’t have access to, video-conferencing software.

## Good practices

- **Choose a research lead.** A research lead is the team member ultimately responsible for setting the research agenda, explaining the team’s methods, tracking the team’s progress, and ensuring research quality.
- **Discuss.** Discuss research plans and interview guides. Debrief after meetings. Ask for the team’s input throughout the process. [Avoid big reveals.](https://medium.com/@stonecrops/the-researchers-journey-leveling-up-as-a-user-researcher-a85cd35b53f5)
- **Separately determine research questions and interview questions.** ([They’re different.](https://medium.com/mule-design/research-questions-are-not-interview-questions-7f90602eb533))
  - Example research question: *How do medical librarians find and make use of academic journal literature in answering questions for their patrons?*
  - Example interview question: *Tell me about the last time you helped a patron answer a question that required you to review academic journal literature.*
- **Be clear about who your research participants are.** How we approach our research will differ depending on whether we are interacting with stakeholders (generally our agency partners), users (those interacting with the system or product we’re investigating), or the public at large. 
- **Make time for [“research operations”](https://medium.com/researchops-community/a-framework-for-whatisresearchops-e862315ab70d).** Continuous research requires ongoing attention to planning, participant recruiting, informing consent, managing data, etc. in addition to time spent on research itself.
- **Regularly review government-specific considerations.** Government-led research must account for a number of [legal]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/legal), [bias]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/bias), [ethical]({{ site.baseurl }}/research/ethics), and [privacy](/research/privacy) considerations. Set up time to read these documents and engage your team in conversations about how you’ll account for them.
