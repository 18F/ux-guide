# About

18F user experience (UX) designers join cross-functional teams to improve interactions between government agencies and the people they serve. This guide is here to help us get the job done. It’s neither a step-by-step tutorial nor a set of rules. Instead, it’s a starting point for UX design at 18F: doing it, discussing it, and ensuring it’s done to a consistent level of quality.


## What this guide is

Like [our Content Guide](https://content-guide.18f.gov/how-to-use-this-guide/), the 18F UX guide is written for designers at our agency, but we hope it’s a useful reference for anyone. We rely on some working assumptions: 18F UX designers [are expected](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xQGIdKoxmOzwyb6Ma-eRkMmk0ic8ugDIDd_I-h2X1cU/edit#)  to possess, among other things, design research skills, the ability to skillfully navigate organizational relationships, and the ability to deliver artifacts that guide development like wireframes and prototypes.

This guide therefore doesn’t dwell on overarching theories of UX, like [the Elements of User Experience](http://www.jjg.net/elements/pdf/elements.pdf), or specific [design methods](https://methods.18f.gov/).  Instead, it includes information that may be new to the designers we hire (who may be new to government), and useful starting points for the people we work with (who may be new to UX design). 18F staff should also consult our [Handbook](https://handbook.18f.gov/), [New Hire README](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19naJ8wgVo_hnv_nUy2WWyzH6DJwXXgenD0QpsZmOSe0/edit#), [Project Start Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jFGksReKrt2PY_QVe7fj1aOCcyjHlGPf5hkKgv7nuMA/edit?pli=1#), and [Before You Ship guide](https://before-you-ship.18f.gov/).


## How to use this guide

We created this guide for reference on an as-needed basis. It’s here when you want a refresher on [ways to protect research participant privacy](/research/privacy/), or you when you need quick access to [UX-related templates, presentations, etc.](/resources/) You’re welcome to read it start to finish, of course.

This guide is divided into three sections:

- **Our Approach** describes essential aspects that shape our design practice: our [team values and principles](/our-approach/values-and-principles); working [definitions of design](/our-approach/defining-design); and our commitment to a pragmatic, [lean approach](/our-approach/lean/). It also describes how we [tailor our approach](/our-approach/tailor-the-approach/) to the people we work with. 
- **Research** describes the process by which we systematically frame problems, explore options, and evaluate solutions. It includes a set of [basics](/research/basics/) (working definitions) as well as information about [planning](/research/plan/), [doing](/research/do), and [analyzing, synthesizing, and sharing](/research/analyze-synthesize-share) research.
- **Design** describes how we communicate ideas throughout the design process. It contains articles on prototyping and sketching.
