# About this guide

18F user experience (UX) designers join cross-functional teams to collaboratively improve user experiences across government. This guide 
is here to help us get the job done. It’s neither a step-by-step tutorial nor a set of rules. Instead, it’s a starting point for 18F-led UX design: doing it, discussing it, and ensuring it’s done to a consistent level of quality.


## What this guide is

Like [our Content Guide](https://content-guide.18f.gov/how-to-use-this-guide/), the 18F UX guide is written for designers at our agency, but we hope it’s a useful reference for anyone. We rely on some working assumptions: 18F UX designers [are expected](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1xQGIdKoxmOzwyb6Ma-eRkMmk0ic8ugDIDd_I-h2X1cU/edit#) to possess, among other things, advanced design research skills, the ability to skillfully navigate organizational relationships, and the ability to deliver artifacts that guide development like wireframes and prototypes.

This guide therefore doesn’t dwell on overarching theories of UX, like [the Elements of User Experience](http://www.jjg.net/elements/pdf/elements.pdf), or specific [design methods](https://methods.18f.gov/). Instead, it includes practical information that may be new to the designers we hire (who may be new to government), and the people we work worh (who may be new to UX design). Readers should also consult our [Handbook](https://handbook.18f.gov/), [New Hire README](https://docs.google.com/document/d/19naJ8wgVo_hnv_nUy2WWyzH6DJwXXgenD0QpsZmOSe0/edit#), [Project Start Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jFGksReKrt2PY_QVe7fj1aOCcyjHlGPf5hkKgv7nuMA/edit?pli=1#), and [Before You Ship guide](https://before-you-ship.18f.gov/).


## How to use this guide

We created this guide for reference on an as-needed basis. It’s here when you’d like a refresher on [ways to protect participant privacy in design research](https://github.com/18F/ux-guide/blob/master/_pages/research/privacy.md), or when you want to communicate to partners the [benefits of sketching](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oMW_O-2f7PmT9S8Rxm2fMgfmFUSEUmdbFe9oivEah1c/edit). You’re welcome to read it start to finish, of course.

This guide is structured into into a few sections. Briefly, they include:

- **Our Approach** contains our team values and principles as well as information about doing government-led UX and our use of Lean UX;
- **Research** contains information about 18F’s approach to design research, including a set of basics for passing along to with partners;
- **Design** contains information about communicating with design: sketching, prototyping, etc.;
- **Resources** contains a collection of links to templates, handy presentations, etc.
