Before you submit your new issue, add labels so that we know which guide/site the work is relevant to. E.g., if the work needs to be done on both the UX guide and the methods cards sites, then add the "UX guide" and the "method cards" labels. Once you're done, delete the text above the line. :)

While it might seem redundant, we have one team that manages issues across multiple products, and these labels help us keep our wires straight!
