# 18F UX Guide Product Owner 
The 18F UX Guide Product Owner is expected to spend an average of two hours a week working towards the following objectives (in collaboration with the UX supervisor, as appropriate):

## Objective A: Ensure the guide reflects the team’s current practices

- Plan for and moderate guide-related meetings with the UX team supervisor, as appropriate (for example, facilitate exercises during the team’s bi-weekly huddle)
- Drive consensus around the UX team’s preferred practices (for example, through things like collaboratively drafting articles and managing a peer review process)

## Objective B: Ensure the guide supports the team’s current practices

- Interview new hires on the UX team a few weeks after their start date to understand what’s intuitive / not about the UX team’s practices
- Work with the 18F Director of Projects to understand what new content (project-related, guide-related, etc.), if any, would better support 18F UX designers
- Create and curate reusable UX resources: templates, case studies, checklists, etc.
- Address outstanding issues in GitHub

## Objective C: Ensure the guide works as part of GSA’s content ecosystem
- Meet regularly with the product owner for 18F’s Methods to ensure mutually supportive content
- Work with the co-leads of the TTS Research Guild to facilitate annual updates to GSA’s Privacy Impact Assessment for Design Research
- Elevate the guide as an 18F product
