18F user experience (UX) designers join cross-functional teams to improve interactions between government agencies and the people they serve. This guide is here to help us get the job done. It’s neither a step-by-step tutorial nor a set of rules. Instead, it’s a starting point for UX design at 18F: doing it, discussing it, and ensuring it’s done to a consistent level of quality.

This guide is divided into three sections:

- **Our Approach** describes essential aspects that shape our design practice: our [values and principles](/our-approach/values-and-principles); working [definitions of design](/our-approach/defining-design); and our commitment to a pragmatic, [lean approach](/our-approach/lean/). It also describes how we [tailor our approach](/our-approach/tailor-the-approach/) to the people we work with. 
- **Research** describes the process by which we systematically frame problems, explore options, and evaluate solutions. It includes a set of [basics](/research/basics/) (working definitions) as well as information about [planning](/research/plan/), [doing](/research/do), and [analyzing, synthesizing, and sharing](/research/analyze-synthesize-share) research.
- **Design** describes how we communicate ideas throughout the design process. It contains articles on prototyping and sketching.
