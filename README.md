# 18F UX Guide

This respository is the eventual home of an [18F guide]() containing the UX team's principles, norms, and resources — essential information for people doing user experience research and design at 18F. This guide is currently under development. You can [preview the site on Federalist](https://federalist-proxy.app.cloud.gov/site/18f/ux-guide/), or get a general overview below.

# Goals

*After **reading** the UX guide, 18F staff should be able to:*

- Identify the principles animating the UX team
- Describe how UX designers employ 18F’s Methods
- Fulfill the high-level duties and responsibilities of UX designers in the federal government (for example, identify salient ethical, legal, and privacy implications of design decisions and research activities)
- Advocate for the UX team’s preferred and nonpreferred (not “best” or “worst”) ways of working, and address common blockers (e.g. recruiting for research)
- Create more consistent, high-quality design documentation


*By **participating** in the creation of the UX guide, members of 18F’s UX team will:*

- Grow as a community of practice by sharing values, principles, and passions
- Align our practices (e.g. implementation of 18F Methods, principles, etc.)
- Discuss and document what the team already knows (i.e., tacit knowledge). (Note: We’ll do this by pairing newer and more experienced 18F staff to [create content](https://github.com/18F/ux-guide/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).)
- Clarify our expectations for new staff
- Clarify the duties/responsibilities of designers in government
- Identify reusable templates, case studies, checklists, etc.
- Determine what design-related material lives where (e.g., Methods vs. this guide)
