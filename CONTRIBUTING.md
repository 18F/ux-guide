# Contributing

This document provides [18F staff contributing to the UX guide](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1WJIDIMJK2Zzk8bA8DOmqd6Fbfp-tHSbk0-Cv9WPfNlo) (though this document also includes [guidance for non-18F contributors](#non-18F-contributors)) with a high-level picture of the editorial process that will shape their contributions. Over the next six weeks we’ll identify goals for your content, outline the article(s) you'll write in service of those goals, and draft and publish those article(s) as part of the larger guide effort. Easy peasy.

If you haven’t seen them yet, please review our [guide's goals](https://github.com/18F/ux-guide/wiki/Goals) and [outline](https://github.com/18F/ux-guide/blob/master/README.md#table-of-contents). If you have any questions or concerns, contact us in [#ux-guide](https://gsa-tts.slack.com/archives/CDDLUQ694/) or ping Andrew, Laura, or Vishal. 


## Milestones

We recognize that you are balancing working on this alongside billable projects, and want to be respectful of your time. In order to keep us moving forward, we’ve put together some initial milestones (that we’ll adjust as needed). 

- **Goals** by January 9th, 2019
- **Outlines** by January 18th, 2019
- **First drafts** by February 1st, 2019
- **Final drafts** by February 15, 2019


## Goals

Kick things off by scheduling a chat with your partner to decide on five goals for your content. 

For example, goals for the “Our approach” section might include (“By reading the ‘our approach’ section of the UX guide, 18F staff will be able to”):

- Conceptualize design as a series of (research and design) decisions that change and articulate a project’s scope — inputs and outputs that help us reach desired outcomes
- Understand why design requires humility, and how UX designers facilitate feedback loops
- Describe how 18F’s approach to UX differs on path analysis vs. experiment and iterate engagements


## Outlines

Once we’re broadly aligned on content goals, outline the content you’ll write. What will you write to meet your content-related goals? What concepts will you need to introduce, and in what order? 

Break the content into as many articles as you need — where each article is between 500 and 1,500 words (or 1-3 pages). This will ensure that the overall guide is succinct, accessible, and (hopefully) easier to maintain. For example, the “Our approach” section might contain three articles: UX at 18F, Lean UX, and coaching and doing. 


## Drafting

Here are some things to keep in mind while writing: 

- The primary audience is 18F staff who are experienced practitioners, so our goal is to capture what’s unique about doing human centered design in our specific context rather than trying to tackle general design-related topics.
- Use first-person and third-person plural (“I”, “we” and “they”) pronouns, and avoid second person (“you”) altogether as it creates a boundary with the reader.
- Connect and link to existing 18F content as much as possible. For example, we’re not looking to duplicate the [Methods](https://methods.18f.gov)!
- Make good use of headings and bullet points. See the [18F content guide](https://content-guide.18f.gov) and [plainlanguage.gov](https://plainlanguage.gov).
