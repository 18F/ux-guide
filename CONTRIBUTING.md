# Contributing

This document provides people who have been asked to substantially contribute content to the 18F UX guide — that is, people on 18F's UX Team — with a high-level picture of the editorial process that will shape their contributions. This document also includes some style advice and a rough timeline.

If you do not work at 18F and are interested in contributing to this guide, you can either email us, file an issue, or submit a pull request. More on that [below](#members-of-the-public). You might also consider forking this guide and customizing it to your organizational needs.


## High-level goals

The editorial process by which our team will manage this Guide is itself designed to be both highly collaborative and highly repeatable. That way, whenever this Guide is deemed outdated or to have sufficiently diverged from what the team knows to be true, we can reliably regroup, rethink, and redraft it.

In the spirit of keeping everyone aligned, all contributions should serve the following high-level goals for readers.

*After reading the 18F UX Guide, 18F staff should be able to:*

- **Identify** and the *values and principles* animating the UX Team
- **Describe** how the UX Team employs [18F’s Methods](https://methods.18f.gov)
- Build alignment around the UX team’s preferred and nonpreferred (not “best” or “worst”) ways of working
- Identify the duties and responsibilities of UX designers in the federal government (for example, identify ethical, legal, and privacy implications of design research)
- Access and reuse templates, blog posts, guides, etc. to ensure more consistent, high-quality design communication


## Where you come in

If you're reading this, you and a colleague ("your partner") have been asked by the UX Supervisor to contribute to a specific *section* of the Guide — congratulations! 

You're probably wondering what's next. Over the next six-to-eight weeks, we’d like to work with you and your partner to describe 5-10 goals for your section, outline the article(s) you'll write (in service of your goals), and draft and publish your article(s) as part of the larger UX Guide effort. Easy peasy. 

## Deadlines

In order to keep content pairs moving towards our shared goals, we're putting some lines in the sand. Here are the deadlines we have in mind for this round of contributions:

1. Section goals are due Jan 9
1. Outlines are due Jan 18
1. Drafts are due Feb 1
1. Final drafts are due Feb 15

## Need help?

We'll review this in a team-wide huddle and provide opportunities to share with the rest of the team. This is all pretty rough at this point. 

Also, please know that the guide's editor/facilitator, Andrew Maier, is available to help should you and your partner like an extra set of eyes/ears (and hands if need be). We're happy to provide feedback every step of the way.
